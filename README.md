# Ryan Ondocin Spotify Analysis
In this project, I will use tableau to combine my passion for making music with DataScience. After downloading my streaming data from tune core, a music distribution platform for artists, I decided to create a dashboard that allows me to compare my song's streams by country, music store, and net sales. Following this, I webscraped Spotify's API using the SpotiPy package from python in order to obtain song-related metadata from some of my favorite artists. The dashboard created as a result allows users to compare the audio features [danceability, tempo.. etc.] of my songs to the likes of musicians that I've always looked up to. To check these dashboards out, visit the links below!
